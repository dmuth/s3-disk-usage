# S3 Disk Usage

Report S3 disk usage stats, including revisions and deleted files.

I wrote this tool in a fit of furstration when I was trying to determine when ~20 GB of 
files in my S3 buckets was being billed as 200 GB of storage.  You see, I really like having
versioning turned on for safety reasons, but disk space can shoot way up if there are many
versions of a file or if there are many deleted files.

This will report on total use across all versions of a file.
